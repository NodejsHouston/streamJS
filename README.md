*Eventual TOC?*


## Goal

- *Milestone 1:* Create a site that broadcasts an animation to all connected users. The animation should be in sync with all users i.e. all users are watching the same thing in real time.

    | Tasks | Details |
    | ----- | ------- |
    | Animation | The animated graphic should be simple and non dynamic. Preferably some sort ascii art with a sweeping horizontal line |
    | Backend Communication | Set up a [Socket.io](http://socket.io/get-started/) server and [stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) the file . Set up [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction) app to host site |
    | Client Communication | Use a [Socket.io](http://socket.io/get-started/) client to display the animation |
